# BlairsEVEConfig (Scientifically Accurate EVE Aurora) (SAEVEA) for short.

This is a config of another mod named EVE Volumetrics Aurorae by jthero3, it is provided as is for that version of the mod, as a result I recommend checking the original:
https://spacedock.info/mod/3843/EVE%20Volumetrics%20Aurorae

this mod absolutely works best if you have OPM.
It's fitting if you have OPM V5 volumetric clouds, which can be found here: 
https://spacedock.info/mod/4060/OPM%20Volumetric%20V5%20configs

depedicies are as follows: 
- Blackrocks EVE volumetric V5

prefered:
- Scatter
- TUFX
- Deferred redering

The following below are some descriptions attached with images to showcase my config:

Eve: Purple Aurorae caused by a high amount of molecular Sulfur and CO2 inside the atmosphere.

Laythe: Green and Blue for the Nitrogen in the Atmosphere, and yellow bands for volcanic sulfur and Sodium launched into the atmosphere as particulates.

Tekto: Purple/Violet and navy Blue because of Hydrocarbons like Methane, Ethane, as well as high amounts of Molecular Nitrogen inside the atmosphere.

Sarnus: Red accents caused by highly energized barely visible hydrogen inside the atmosphere and the predominant purple is caused by helium and molecular hydrogen as well as trace argon and ammonia.

Neidon: same story as Sarnus, but more so.
